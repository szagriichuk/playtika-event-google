What is an algorithm?

An algorithm is a procedure to accomplish a specific task.
An algorithm is the idea behind any reasonable computer program.
To be interesting, an algorithm must solve a general, well-specified problem. An
algorithmic problem is specified by describing the complete set of instances it must
work on and of its output after running on one of these instances.
